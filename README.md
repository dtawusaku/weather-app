# Weather App
This NodeJS application allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city using the OpenWeather API. The application prompts the user to enter a city name, and then displays the current weather conditions for that city, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather.

-- Currently, it displays only the description of the weather.
